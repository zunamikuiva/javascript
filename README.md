Simple Calculator Project
This project is a basic calculator built with HTML and JavaScript, designed as an introduction to JavaScript programming. It provides simple mathematical operations through a user-friendly interface.

About the Project
Purpose: The calculator was created as an initial project to explore JavaScriptâ€™s capabilities and understand the basics of interactive web development.
Technologies Used:
HTML for creating the layout,
CSS for basic styling (if applicable),
JavaScript for the core calculation functions and interactive behavior.
Project Motivation: This was my first experience with JavaScript, and it serves as a foundational project to build my skills in front-end programming.
Features
Basic Operations: The calculator can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Simple User Interface: Buttons for digits and operators are easy to use, and results display directly on the screen.
JavaScript Logic: The calculator uses JavaScript functions to process user inputs and return the correct output for each operation.
